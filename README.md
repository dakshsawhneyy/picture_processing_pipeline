# Picture Processing Pipeline

Most image processing apps today? Locked behind subscriptions or bloated services.

So I built my own. End-to-end. Real-time. Scalable.

## What I Built

A complete picture processing pipeline using:
- Node.js (Express) for the backend
- Redis + BullMQ for job queueing
- Sharp.js for powerful image processing
- Arena UI to monitor queue activity

Every image gets picked, queued, processed, resized, and stored. All automatically.

## Features

- Asynchronous and fault-tolerant architecture
- Built-in job status monitoring with Arena UI
- Fail-safe error handling with retry support
- Auto-generated logs and structured job data
- Clean, production-ready code

## Stack

- Node.js
- Express.js
- Redis (local or containerized)
- BullMQ
- Sharp.js
- Arena UI

## How it Works

1. Upload an image to the backend API.
2. Image data is pushed to a Redis queue (BullMQ).
3. A worker listens to the queue, processes the image using Sharp, and stores it.
4. Monitor everything from Arena UI in real time.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` in both `api/` and `worker/` folders
3. Start Redis server (can be via Docker)
4. Run the backend server and worker
5. Access Arena UI at `http://localhost:9000`

## Why I Built This

Image pipelines are usually abstracted, locked behind paywalls, or under-documented. I wanted full control, full visibility, and full performance.

This project helped me master Redis, BullMQ, and async architecture in real-world backend systems.

Built confidently by Daksh Sawhney â€” because reinventing pipelines is better than paying for one.
